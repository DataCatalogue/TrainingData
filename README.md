# Training datasets for training GROBID sale catalogues models

Each directory of this repository contains datasets created to train GROBID sale catalogues models. Datasets are divided based on where original documents are being kept. For instance, each annotated catalogue originated from the Biblioth√®que nationale de France is stored in a "BnF" directory. Annotated files are in the TEI-XML format.

## Naming convention

* BnF files are named with the Gallica ark identifier.
* INHA files are named with the identifier provided in their online notice.

## GROBID models

* Segmentation : the segmentation model aims to obtain a high level segmentation of the catalogues. 

## Data quality

Before being pushed to the main branch, annotated files have at least been proofread once.
